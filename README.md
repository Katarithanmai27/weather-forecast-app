# weather-forecast-app
A responsive weather forecast web app built with JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and OpenWeatherMap API.

## 📖 About the Project

This Weather Forecast App is a web-based application that allows users to check current weather conditions and 5-day forecasts for any city, as well as their current location. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time data and is styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-responsive UI.

### Key Highlights:
- 🔍 Search weather by city name
- 📍 Fetch weather using current geolocation
- 🧠 Smart dropdown for recently searched cities (localStorage)
- 📅 View extended 5-day forecast with temperature, wind, humidity & icons
- 💻 Fully responsive on desktop, tablets, and mobile (iPhone SE, iPad Mini)
- ⚠️ Graceful error handling for invalid inputs or API errors

This project demonstrates practical use of APIs, responsive web design, and browser storage with JavaScript.
